# Personal NeoVim

Been using NeoVim as my primary coding environment for a few weeks now and really like it.

Based on [KickStart Nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)

That should probably be anyone's starting point as this configuration is tailored to my preferences. Storing on github to have issue tracking and a configuration backup.
